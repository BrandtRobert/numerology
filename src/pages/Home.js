            Welcome to the react based numerology calculator. Numerology is similiar to astrology basing its
            predictions on birthdates and years. However, numerology is principally based on a set of powerful numbers,
            and reduction based math.

            I was introduced to numerology by my aunt who loves to caclulate it for people and make predictions based on their
            numbered days.
            I've decided to create this calculator as a way to automate the process of determining your weekly, daily, monthly
            and yearly numerology.
